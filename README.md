# CPS1-Palette-Dump-to-ACT-Converter
A simple python script that takes in a dumped palette from CPS1/2 Pal_RAM and converts it to equivalent .act files

Made using Python 3.12.4, though later versions should be fine too. I lament the need for a .bat file but for whatever reason Python wasn't playing nice with this one otherwise and this gets it to work, so I don't really feel a need to dive into why
